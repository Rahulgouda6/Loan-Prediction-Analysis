**Loan Prediction Analysis** is a project to predict if a loan will be approved based on customer details like income, credit history, and job type. It uses data analysis and machine learning to build a model that helps banks decide quickly and accurately. The steps include cleaning the data, understanding patterns, creating a predictive model, and checking its accuracy. This saves time and improves loan approval decisions.
